# Frontend Refactoring - Testing Checklist

## Architecture & Configuration

- [x] All CSS moved to `styles/app.css`
- [x] All JavaScript moved to `scripts/app.js`
- [x] Configuration loaded from `/config.json` with fallback defaults
- [x] No hardcoded API keys in source code
- [x] CSS variables defined for theme customization

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance)

### Semantic HTML
- [ ] Verify `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>` tags are used correctly
- [ ] Check heading hierarchy (h1 â†’ h2 â†’ h3)
- [ ] Ensure forms use proper `<label>` associations

### ARIA Implementation
- [ ] Tab navigation implements `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, `role="tabpanel"`
- [ ] Tabs have correct `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, `aria-labelledby`
- [ ] Hidden panels have `aria-hidden="true"`
- [ ] Status regions have `aria-live="polite"` or `aria-live="assertive"`
- [ ] Interactive elements have appropriate `aria-label` or `aria-describedby`

### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] **Tab key** moves through all interactive elements in logical order
- [ ] **Left/Right arrow keys** switch between tabs
- [ ] **Home key** jumps to first tab
- [ ] **End key** jumps to last tab
- [ ] All buttons and links are keyboard-accessible
- [ ] Focus indicator is visible (2px outline)
- [ ] No keyboard traps exist

### Screen Reader Testing
- [ ] Tab names are announced correctly
- [ ] Tab panel content is announced when switching tabs
- [ ] Status messages are announced via `aria-live` regions
- [ ] Form labels and hints are read correctly
- [ ] Error messages are announced assertively
- [ ] Loading states are announced

**Tools to use:**
- NVDA (Windows): https://www.nvaccess.org/
- JAWS (Windows): https://www.freedomscientific.com/
- VoiceOver (Mac): Cmd+F5
- ChromeVox (Chrome extension)

## UX Enhancements

- [ ] Cache is cleared when coming back online

### Performance
- [ ] Scripts loaded with `defer` attribute
- [ ] No heavy inline styles in HTML
- [ ] CSS transitions used instead of JS animations
- [ ] Responses cached for 30 seconds per machine ID

## Feature-Specific Tests

## Quick Testing Commands

### Test with Keyboard Only
1. Unplug mouse or don't use it
2. Press Tab to navigate through all elements
3. Press Enter/Space to activate buttons
4. Use Arrow keys in tab navigation
5. Verify all features are accessible

### Test with Screen Reader
1. Enable screen reader (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver)
2. Navigate through the page with Tab
3. Switch tabs and verify announcements
4. Submit a form and verify status announcements
5. Check that loading states are announced

### Test Network Failures
1. Open DevTools â†’ Network tab
2. Set throttling to "Offline"
3. Try to make API calls
4. Verify graceful error messages
5. Set back to "Online"
6. Verify recovery message

### Test Caching
1. Make a prediction for machine M-001
2. Check Network tab for API call
3. Immediately make the same prediction again
4. Verify no new API call (cached)
5. Wait 31 seconds
6. Make prediction again
7. Verify new API call (cache expired)
